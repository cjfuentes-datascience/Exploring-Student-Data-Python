# Exploring-Student-Data-Python

Imagine that I work for a school district and have collected some data on local students and their parents. I’ve been tasked with answering some important questions:

1. How are students performing in their math classes?
2. What do students’ parents do for work?
3. How often are students absent from school?

In this project, I’ll explore and summarize some student data in order to answer these questions.
